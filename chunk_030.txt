Q: How do I op(cid:415)mize model performance for mobile deployment?
A: Use model compression techniques, quan(cid:415)za(cid:415)on, pruning, and our mobile-op(cid:415)mized deployment
op(cid:415)ons. We provide tools to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy.
Q: Can I use GPU accelera(cid:415)on for training?
A: Yes, GPU accelera(cid:415)on is available on Professional and Enterprise plans. It significantly reduces
training (cid:415)me for large models and complex datasets.
